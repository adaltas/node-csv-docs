# Option `comment`

Treat all the characters after this one as a comment. It can be made of one or multiple escape characters. It is disabled by default by defining an empty string `""`.

* Type: `boolean`
* Optional
* Default: `""`
* Since: early days

The escape sequence can be defined at the begining of record (a line if the record delimiter is a line return) or anywhere else. Every characters found after the escape sequence will be disregarded.

Escaping is disabled inside a quoted field. The escape sequence will be preserved like any other bytes. It cannot be escaped.

# Example

The [comment example](https://github.com/adaltas/node-csv/blob/master/packages/csv-parse/samples/option.comment.js) insert two comments, one at the begining of the file and another one after a record.

```js
const parse = require('csv-parse/lib/sync')
const assert = require('assert')

const data = `
# At the beginning of a record
"hello"
"world"# At the end of a record
`.trim()
const records = parse(data, {
  comment: "#"
})
assert.deepStrictEqual(records, [
  [ "hello" ],
  [ "world" ]
])
```
