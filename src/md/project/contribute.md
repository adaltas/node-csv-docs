# Contribution Guide

## Introduction

This is a community effort. Please be grateful to the people who write code, take time filling bug reports and improve the documentation.

We encourage you to contribute to the project. Sometime, great contributions take a second. As an example, correcting a typo on this page would as simple as editing this page on GitHub and everyone will benefit from it.

## Development

Tests are executed with mocha. To install it, simple run `npm install` followed by `npm test`. It will install mocha and its dependencies in your project "node_modules" directory and run the test suite. The tests run against the CoffeeScript source files.

To generate the JavaScript files, run `make build`.

The test suite is run online with [Travis][travis] against the versions 0.10 and 0.11 of Node.js.
